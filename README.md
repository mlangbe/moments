All files related to the tensorsets/moments/etc, mostly created during ml's phd thesis time.

In subdirectory moments (license:gpl) the code needed for creating the invariant calulators , tensor symmetry, on optimized spleit tree is present, moreover my arbitrary-precision number library I used to asses the independency of the the different polynomials, and an interval-arithmetic library used to assess the correctness and the sensitivity of the moments.
Most of the code is header-only.


In subdirectory kegellager, an example using  interval arithmetics to create a amrching-cubes triangulation from an analytic implicit description of the objects is given (also license gpl)

In subdirectory tnt, a copy of the Template Numerical Toolkit (TNT) from nist is given , a dependency for some of the algorithms in moments (license: is public domain)
